# Book Search Engine Starter Code

## Description
This assignment was rather difficult, as it wasn't clicking as much as it needed to be. The concept of this assignment was to have a MERN reactive book search engine using a Google API. I did what I could on it and got some of it done, but the public part was a bit of a struggle for me with the queries and the mutations.
